# Game Technology

Recently I am studying game technology, such as 3D rendering, game scripts, physics engines, applying multithreading in games, cross-platform game engines, etc.  
My first game engine has been open sourced, and I used it to write a remake of Resident Evil 2 (1998). Now I am writing a second game engine with a completely new approach. 
You may ask me why I donâ€™t use a ready-made game engine? Because it is fun and I can do it.

I used to be the CEO of a small company. I designed system functions, database structure and completed coding according to the requirements. I have worked on software for education/medical/automotive embedding/subway operation data, etc.

New technologies only take me tens of minutes to a few hours.

The way I like to work is give me the requirements and I will give you the program.
