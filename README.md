### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am a professional programmer, and now I am working as a technical director in a company.
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning MCU programming so I can make some interesting hardware.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking for cooperation...
- ðŸ¤” A Resident Evil Respawn project I was working on was interrupted because the reverse engineering information was incomplete and I need help.
- ðŸ˜„ I don't like to go out, because the nearby scenery is no longer fresh, I will travel to very distant places.
- âš¡ Once the time is right, I will start making a game of my dreams.
